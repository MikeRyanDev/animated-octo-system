# AGENTS.md

This file defines the default engineering rules for this repository and everything under it.

## Core Principles

- Use strict TypeScript and prove correctness through strong, explicit types.
- Favor functional programming with small, composable, single-purpose functions.
- Isolate side effects.
- Model side-effect orchestration with idiomatic RxJS.
- Refactor aggressively toward this target architecture when relevant to the task.

## TypeScript Requirements

- TypeScript must be configured and used in strict mode.
- Treat the following as hard requirements:
  - `strict: true`
  - `noImplicitAny: true`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Do not use `any`.
- Do not use type assertions unless they are a narrow, documented escape hatch.
- Use exhaustive union handling with `never` checks.
- Prefer type-level modeling that makes invalid states unrepresentable.

## Functional + Reactive Patterns

- Prefer function composition over shared mutable state.
- Keep core logic pure.
- Never throw from core logic.
- If exceptions are necessary, isolate them to side-effect boundaries.
- Use RxJS idiomatically for side effects and async workflows.
- Avoid manual `subscribe()` in application logic where composition/effects can be used.
- Do not use nested subscriptions.
- Keep streams cold by default; document hot/shared streams explicitly.
- Model state using an event/reducer pattern in RxJS pipelines.

## State and Mutation

- Treat state as immutable by default.
- Do not mutate function inputs.
- Disallow in-place mutation except for performance-critical, local-only mutation.
- Any permitted local mutation must include clear TSDoc justification.
- Do not rely on pervasive `readonly` typing as a blanket rule.

## TSDoc

- Every function must have TSDoc, including internal/private functions.
- TSDoc should capture purpose, inputs, outputs, side effects, and error behavior.

## Imports and Modules

- Prefer named exports.
- Path aliases are allowed when they point to the root of a library/module boundary.
- Sort imports with this order:
  - path-alias imports first (sorted)
  - relative imports second (sorted)

## Runtime Validation

- Validate all external input boundaries at runtime.
- External boundaries include HTTP, database IO, queues/events, environment variables, and other untyped inputs.
- Prefer `zod@4` for boundary validation.
- Keep internal logic driven by static types after boundary validation.

## Dependency Policy

- Prefer standard library and existing dependencies first.
- New dependencies require clear justification in PR/task notes.

## Testing Requirements

- Use `vitest`.
- TDD is required for new logic:
  - write a failing test first
  - run tests to confirm failure
  - implement code
  - run tests to confirm passing
- Unit tests are required for all new logic.
- Use `test(...)` style only.
- Do not use `describe`, `beforeEach`, `it`, or similar block-style APIs.
- Structure tests clearly with Arrange / Act / Assert sections.
- Mock only at side-effect boundaries (network, filesystem, time, randomness, process/env, etc.).
- Prefer real collaborators for pure/internal logic.
- Coverage goal is high confidence with enforced minimums:
  - 95% lines
  - 95% branches
  - 95% functions
  - 95% statements

## Quality Gates

Before considering work complete, all of the following must pass:

- lint
- format check
- typecheck
- unit tests
- coverage thresholds
- build

Preferred script contract (npm):

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test -- --coverage`
- `npm run build`

If scripts are missing, add/update scripts to satisfy this contract as part of the task.
